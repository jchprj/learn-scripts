By default, the git remote command will list previously stored remote connections to other repositories. This will produce single line output that lists the names of "bookmark" name of remote repos.
```
git remote
```

Invoking git remote with the -v option will print the list of bookmarked repository names and additionally, the corresponding repository URL. The -v option stands for "verbose". Below is example output of verbose git remote output.

```
git remote -v
