Unlike traditional programming that considers objects, the fundamental unit of reactive reasoning is the stream of events.

In reactive, exceptions are first class citizens, treated every bit as such. Since streams are generally asynchronous, it doesnâ€™t make sense to throw an exception, so instead any exception is passed as an event in the stream.
