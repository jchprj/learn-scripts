# Application Programming Interface

This could include anything.

There are many public API resources online available. They are very close to scripting.


## Files

### .http

Used in VS Code with extension [Rest Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client)

Then could call the API by a mouse click when opening the file in VS Code.

### Shebang

Executable, maybe a curl or some scripts which supports Shebang.
