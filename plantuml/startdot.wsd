' Since PlantUML uses Graphviz/DOT, it is possible to directly use DOT language. This means that you can use Graphviz/DOT with all tools that support PlantUML.

@startdot
digraph foo {
  node [style=rounded]
  node1 [shape=box]
  node2 [fillcolor=yellow, style="rounded,filled", shape=diamond]
  node3 [shape=record, label="{ a | b | c }"]

  node1 -> node2 -> node3
}
@enddot
