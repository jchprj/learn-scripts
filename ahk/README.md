# AutoHotKey

For Windows only

The source code has two major version, need different exe file to compile. All v1 codes are in folder v1.

Some scripts are copied from others, some are writter by me.


## Run in VS Code

For v2 codes, could use [Code Runner](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.code-runner) extension run directly(with AutoHotKey.exe in path).

For v1 codes, added task `AutoHotKey v1` to run(with AutoHotKey1.exe in path).
